how to start with flask run --debug and why it brokern

do i need to have production and dev debug levels in config.json
if so, wheres that set??

should requirments.txt be installed automatically or after setting up venv?


should logger be called as self.logger?

I think all my data is sent every tick, should it only be sent when we access that page? Or is that bad practice
